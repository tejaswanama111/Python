# Comparison operators
# Comparison operators are used to compare values. It returns either True or False according to the condition.

# Operator	Meaning	Example
#  >    Greater than - True if left operand is greater than the right	x > y
#  <    Less than - True if left operand is less than the right	x < y
#  ==	Equal to - True if both operands are equal	x == y
#  !=	Not equal to - True if operands are not equal	x != y
#  >=	Greater than or equal to - True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right	x >= y
#  <=	Less than or equal to - True if left operand is less than or equal to the right	x <= y

x = int(input("Enter first number :"))
y = int(input("Enter second number :"))

print('x > y is',x>y)

print('x < y is',x<y)

print('x == y is',x==y)

print('x != y is',x!=y)

print('x >= y is',x>=y)

print('x <= y is',x<=y)
